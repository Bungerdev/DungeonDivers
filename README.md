Fable Forge II
This is the Beta Testing respository for FFGII!
Fable Forge is a 2D Top-Down online co-op adventure RPG Rogue-lite where you craft your character from class, and race, to gear, alligment, and beliefs.
You and up to 4 of your friends are dropped into a world, and one-shot campaign of YOUR choosing. Every time a player dies, or completes the campaign,
they unlock more races, perks, and gear to add onto, or rewrite their character with! The twist of these worlds being that one of your friends is the narrator!
The narrator has full control over all enemies, bosses, loot drops, world events, and NPC's! With our WRTC Voice Chat system, the Narrator is free to improv NPC
lines based on an outline menu each NPC has upon clicking on them! 
With 8 Classes, 16 sub-classes, and 10 races, there's plenty to experiment with.
